Making decision easy!!!
Policy Simulation Tool
Overview
The Policy Simulation Tool is an AI-driven platform that helps simulate the economic impact of various policy changes. Users can input key policy parameters such as tax rates, public spending, inflation rates, and GDP growth to receive insights and data visualizations. The tool supports governments and organizations in making informed decisions.

Features
User Authentication: Register, login, and manage sessions securely.
Policy Simulation: Input policy data and visualize results with dynamic charts.
Responsive Design: Optimized for desktop and mobile using CSS Grid and Flexbox.
Security: Implements session management, bcrypt for password hashing, Helmet for HTTP headers security, and input validation.
Performance: Efficient database queries and connection pooling.
Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MySQL
Security: Bcrypt, express-session, Helmet

Security Measures
Password Hashing: Uses bcrypt to hash user passwords.
Session Management: Manages sessions securely with express-session.
Helmet: Adds secure HTTP headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
Input Validation: Validates inputs on both frontend and backend to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites:
Node.js installed
MySQL database running
Steps:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/policy-simulation-tool.git  
cd policy-simulation-tool  
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install  
Set up the database:

Create a MySQL database:
sql
Copy code
CREATE DATABASE policy_simulation;  
Run the provided SQL script to set up tables:
bash
Copy code
mysql -u your_user -p policy_simulation < db/schema.sql  
Configure environment variables:
Create a .env file in the root directory:

bash
Copy code
DB_HOST=localhost  
DB_USER=root  
DB_PASSWORD=your_password  
DB_NAME=policy_simulation  
SESSION_SECRET=your_secret  
Start the server:

bash
Copy code
npm start  
The server will run on http://localhost:3000.

API Endpoints
Authentication:
POST /auth/register – Register a new user.
POST /auth/login – Log in an existing user.
GET /auth/logout – Log out the user.
Simulation:
POST /simulate – Simulate a policy based on user inputs.
Testing
Run tests using Mocha and Chai:

bash
Copy code
npm test
